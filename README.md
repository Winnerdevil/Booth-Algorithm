# Booth-Algorithm
The Booth Algorithm is implemented in the logisim.

In this project I have implemented the booth algorithm with 4 bit,

 ***WHAT IT INCLUDE:***
> AC, BR, QR, Q(n+1), counter,
	4-bit substractor, 4-Adder ,
	comparater circuits.

**Note**:
		here AC, QR and Q(n+1) is made with the help of D flip-flop.
```
Example:
	BR	AC	QR	Q(n+1)	SC
	0010  	0000	0010	0	4
	0010	0000	0001	0	3
	0010	0010	0000	1	2
	0010	0100	0000	0	1
	0010	0100	0000	0	0
  ```

so, answer for the BR = 2 and QR = 2 is 4.
this example is explained in the video provided.
